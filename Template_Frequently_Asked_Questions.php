                <p class="pt-10 pb-10">When CoDev hires an employee for a partner, they become full-time employees of
                    our company. If a partner no longer requires the employee’s services at no fault of the employee, we
                    continue to pay and provide benefits to the employee while we reskill them for a new engagement.
                    This ensures that CoDev retains top talent and quickly meets partner talent needs.</p>
                <p class="pt-10 pb-10">We also continuously measure the contributions of CoDev employees to our partners
                    using third-party tools. If an employee is coming against technical hurdles, our customer success
                    team will engage our partners to help develop a plan to overcome those hurdles. If an employee
                    requires new skills, these tools identify that obstacle, and we provide the employee with resources
                    to acquire those skills.</p>
                <p class="pt-10 pb-10">CoDev also provides secured machines to each employee, in-country supervision,
                    and 24/7 IT support to ensure they are always productive on the client’s behalf.</p>

                <p class="pt-10 pb-10">With CoDev, we recruit a developer for YOUR team. They are not working on other
                    projects or looking for their next opportunity. You have an ongoing relationship with your team
                    member ensuring questions about the product, continuity between releases and coding style is
                    consistent. This is a key differentiator with CoDev vs. other types of services; you are a partner,
                    not a project.</p>
